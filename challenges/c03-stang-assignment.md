*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename) %>%
  rename(
    "nu_00" = "mu_00",
    "nu_45" = "mu_45",
    "nu_90" = "mu_90"
  )
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, mu_00, E_45, mu_45, E_90, mu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "varang",
    values_to = "value",
    cols = c(-thick, -alloy)
  ) %>%
  separate(
    col = varang,
    into = c("var", "angle"),
    sep = "_",
    convert = TRUE
  ) %>%
  group_by(var) %>%
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = var, values_from = value) %>%
  select(-row) %>%
  filter(E > 0)

df_stang_long
```

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you’d like to answer about the data—you’ll answer it below in q3.

``` r
distinct(df_stang_long, thick)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 1
    ##   thick
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1 0.022
    ## 2 0.032
    ## 3 0.064
    ## 4 0.081

``` r
distinct(df_stang_long, angle, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 5
    ##   thick alloy   angle     E    nu
    ##   <dbl> <chr>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ## 2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ## 3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - No, there is not.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - There is one type of aluminium alloy in this dataset, because under
    the “alloy” column all the samples have the same value of “al_24st”.
- What angles were tested?
  - 0, 45, 90.
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, 0.081.
- How is nu related to angle?
  - nu is usually the greatest at 45 degrees.

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
ggplot(df_stang_long) +
  geom_point(aes(
    x = angle, 
    y = nu, 
    color = thick, 
    size = E
  ))
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The statement that “nu is usually the greatest at 45 degrees” remains
  generally true especially when we compare the dots of the same
  thickness (distinguished by color). The dots at 45 degrees are mainly
  located at the top of the graph, representing the greatest values of
  nu.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?  
- The following graph contradicts with the claim that “elasticity E is
an intensive material property,” because the elasticity of the material
increases as the amount of it increases.  
- This evidence is not conclusive. Although the existing data shows that
the conclusion the elasticity of the material increases as the amount of
it increases” is correct, we need more data points taken from a wider
range to make the statement conclusive, i.e. we need a wider range of
thickness as well as smaller intervals between every two adjacent
thickness values. For each thickness, ideally we should have more data
points (e.g. at least 10).

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - The graph contradicts with the claim that “elasticity E is an
    intensive material property”, because the purple dots which stand
    for the thickest aluminium tend to have the smallest E values while
    the red dots that stand for the thinnest aluminium tend to have the
    highest elasticity.
