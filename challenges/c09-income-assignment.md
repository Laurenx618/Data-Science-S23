*Purpose*: We’ve been learning how to quantify uncertainty in estimates
through the exercises; now its time to put those skills to use studying
real data. In this challenge we’ll use concepts like confidence
intervals to help us make sense of census data.

Error](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2020/calculating-margins-of-error-acs.html)

You might wonder why the `Margin of Error` in the population estimates
is listed as `*****`. From the [documentation (PDF
link)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj81Omy16TrAhXsguAKHTzKDQEQFjABegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Facs%2Ftech_docs%2Faccuracy%2FMultiyearACSAccuracyofData2018.pdf%3F&usg=AOvVaw2TOrVuBDlkDI2gde6ugce_)
for the ACS:

> If the margin of error is displayed as ‘\*\*\*\*\*’ (five asterisks),
> the estimate has been controlled to be equal to a fixed value and so
> it has no sampling error. A standard error of zero should be used for
> these controlled estimates when completing calculations, such as those
> in the following section.

This means that for cases listed as `*****` the US Census Bureau
recommends treating the margin of error (and thus standard error) as
zero.

### **q2** Obtain median income data from the Census Bureau:

- `Filter > Topics > Income and Poverty > Income and Poverty`
- `Filter > Geography > County > All counties in United States`
- Look for `Median Income in the Past 12 Months` (Table S1903)
- Download the 2018 5-year ACS estimates; save to your `data` folder and
  add the filename below.

``` r
## TODO: Give the filename for your copy of Table S1903
filename_income <- "C:/Users/zxiong/Desktop/Olin/C-Data Science/data-science-curriculum-build/challenges/data/ACSST5Y2018.S1903-Data.csv"

## NOTE: No need to edit
df_income <-
  read_csv(filename_income, skip = 1)
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...483`

    ## Warning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,
    ## e.g.:
    ##   dat <- vroom(...)
    ##   problems(dat)

    ## Rows: 3220 Columns: 483
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (306): Geography, Geographic Area Name, Annotation of Margin of Error!!N...
    ## dbl (176): Estimate!!Number!!HOUSEHOLD INCOME BY RACE AND HISPANIC OR LATINO...
    ## lgl   (1): ...483
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Use the following test to check that you downloaded the correct file:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use to check you got the right file.
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_income %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001") %>%
    pull(`Estimate!!Percent Distribution!!FAMILY INCOME BY FAMILY SIZE!!2-person families`)
  == 45.6
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Well done!")
```

    ## [1] "Well done!"

This dataset is in desperate need of some *tidying*. To simplify the
task, we’ll start by considering the `\\d-person families` columns
first.

### **q3** Tidy the `df_income` dataset by completing the code below. Pivot and rename the columns to arrive at the column names `id, geographic_area_name, category, income_estimate, income_moe`.

*Hint*: You can do this in a single pivot using the `".value"` argument
and a `names_pattern` using capture groups `"()"`. Remember that you can
use an OR operator `|` in a regex to allow for multiple possibilities in
a capture group, for example `"(Estimate|Margin of Error)"`.

``` r
df_q3 <-
  df_income %>%
  select(
    Geography,
    contains("Geographic"),
    # This will select only the numeric d-person family columns;
    # it will ignore the annotation columns
    contains("median") & matches("\\d-person families") & !contains("Annotation of")
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("median"), as.numeric)) %>%
## TODO: Pivot the data, rename the columns
  pivot_longer(
    cols =! c("Geography", "Geographic Area Name"),
    names_to = c(".value", "category"),
    names_pattern = "(Estimate|Margin of Error).*(\\d-person families)"
    ) %>%
  rename(
    geographic_area_name = "Geographic Area Name",
    income_estimate = "Estimate",
    income_moe = "Margin of Error"
  )
```

  # "Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe"
```

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q3),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_q3 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_moe)
  == 6663
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

The data gives finite values for the Margin of Error, which is closely
related to the Standard Error. The Census Bureau documentation gives the
following relationship between Margin of Error and Standard Error:

$$\text{MOE} = 1.645 \times \text{SE}.$$

### **q4** Convert the margin of error to standard error. Additionally, compute a 99% confidence interval on income, and normalize the standard error to `income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate`. Provide these columns with the names `income_SE, income_lo, income_hi, income_CV`.

``` r
q99 <- qnorm( 1 - (1 - 0.99) / 2 )

df_q4 <- 
  df_q3 %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  mutate(
    income_SE = income_moe / 1.645,
    income_lo = income_estimate - q99 * income_SE,
    income_hi = income_estimate + q99 * income_SE,
    income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate
  ) 
  
mean
```

    ## function (x, ...) 
    ## UseMethod("mean")
    ## <bytecode: 0x0000019446bb9b28>
    ## <environment: namespace:base>

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q4),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe",
    "income_SE", "income_lo", "income_hi", "income_CV")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_SE) - 4050.456
  ) / 4050.456 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_lo) - 54513.72
  ) / 54513.72 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_hi) - 75380.28
  ) / 75380.28 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_CV) - 0.06236556
  ) / 0.06236556 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

One last wrangling step: We need to join the two datasets so we can
compare population with income.

### **q5** Join `df_q4` and `df_pop`.

``` r
## TODO: Join df_q4 and df_pop by the appropriate column

df_data <-
  merge(
  df_q4, 
  df_pop, 
  by = "Geography"
  ) %>%
  select(-"Geographic Area Name")
```

# Analysis

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We now have both estimates and confidence intervals for
`\\d-person families`. Now we can compare cases with quantified
uncertainties: Let’s practice!

### **q6** Study the following graph, making sure to note what you can *and can’t* conclude based on the estimates and confidence intervals. Document your observations below and answer the questions.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
wid <- 0.5

df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Massachusetts")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

    ## Warning: `fct_reorder()` removing 2 missing values.
    ## ℹ Use `.na_rm = TRUE` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `.na_rm = FALSE` to preserve NAs.

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).

**Observations**:

- Document your observations here.
  - The median household income difference among different categories (2
    to 6 -person families) is the smallest in Suffolk.
  - Nantucket and Dukes have the greatest confidence intervals of median
    household income values among all the counties.
  - Median household income generally increases as the number of people
    in the families increases, but there are some exceptions especially
    regarding 6-person families.
- Can you confidently distinguish between household incomes in Suffolk
  county? Why or why not?
  - No, we cannot. The median household income among different
    categories are quite similar compared to other counties, and the
    confidence intervals overlap to a great extent.
- Which counties have the widest confidence intervals?
  - Nantucket and Dukes.

In the next task you’ll investigate the relationship between population
and uncertainty.

### **q7** Plot the standard error against population for all counties. Create a visual that effectively highlights the trends in the data. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint*: Remember that standard error is a function of *both* variability
(e.g. variance) and sample size.

``` r
df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Massachusetts")) %>%

  ggplot(
    aes(population_estimate, income_SE, color = category)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  guides(x =  guide_axis(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number_si()) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(
    y = "Income Standard Error",
    x = "Population"
  )
```

    ## Warning: `label_number_si()` was deprecated in scales 1.2.0.
    ## ℹ Please use the `scale_cut` argument of `label_number()` instead.
    ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
    ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q7-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- What *overall* trend do you see between `SE` and population? Why might
  this trend exist?
  - The income standard error decreases on a log base 10 scale along
    with the increase of population.
- What does this *overall* trend tell you about the relative ease of
  studying small vs large counties?
  - It’s easier to study the larger counties because they tend to have a
    smaller standard error.

# Going Further

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! You have income data for every county in the United
States: Pose your own question and try to answer it with the data.

### **q8** Pose your own question about the data. Create a visualization (or table) here, and document your observations.

``` r
## TODO: Pose and answer your own question about the data
df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Maine")) %>%

  ggplot(
    aes(population_estimate, income_estimate, color = category)
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  guides(x =  guide_axis(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number_si()) +
  labs(
    y = "Income Estimate",
    x = "Population"
  )
```

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q8-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The income estimation in Maine generally has an increasing trend along
  with a growing population per county, except that there are two
  distinct spikes across all the household categories that appeared when
  population is roughly 31k and 35k.

Ideas:

- Compare trends across counties that are relevant to you; e.g. places
  you’ve lived, places you’ve been, places in the US that are
  interesting to you.
- In q3 we tidied the median `\\d-person families` columns only.
  - Tidy the other median columns to learn about other people groups.
  - Tidy the percentage columns to learn about how many households of
    each category are in each county.
- Your own idea!
