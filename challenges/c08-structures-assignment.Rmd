*Purpose*: Most real problems have multiple sources of uncertainty mixed together. Untangling these different sources can be challenging, even on a conceptual level. In this challenge we'll study a simple problem of structural safety, and use this small case study to untangle sources of sampling and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

*Note*: In this challenge I provide a lot of stub-code; you won't have to do too much coding. This is because I want you to *focus on answering the conceptual questions*. The most important questions in this challenge are: *What sources of uncertainty are you accounting for? What sources are you not accounting for? Are those sources real or induced?*

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight** before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true) for more information.

# Setup

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

```{r setup}
library(MASS)
library(rsample)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
filename_samples <- "./data/al_samples.csv"

```

*Background*: The [strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength) of a material is the amount of mechanical stress it can survive before breaking. To illustrate: Stresses are internal forces that hold an object together when we try to squeeze, stretch, or otherwise deform a solid object. For instance, if we pull on a rectangular bar of material, internal stresses $\sigma$ work to keep the bar together.

*Strength* is a measure of how much internal stress an object can survive: A higher strength means a stronger material. This challenge's data are very simple: They are (synthetic) observations of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) on individual samples of the same aluminum alloy. The experiments were carried out following the higest standards of experimental rigor, so you should consider these values to be the "true" breaking strength for each sample.

```{r read-data}
## NOTE: No need to edit; load data
df_samples <- read_csv(filename_samples)
df_samples
```

Data Dictionary:

| Quantity       | Units |
|----------------|-------|
| Strength (UTS) | psi   |

### **q1** Visualize the strength data with a histogram. Answer the questions below.

```{r q1-task}
df_samples %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = strength)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

**Observations**:

-   What is the mean strength of the material, approximately?
    -   The mean strength is around 40,000.
-   To what extent can you tell what shape the distribution of the data has?
    -   In general, the dataset has relatively more counts when the strength is around 40,000 (roughly in the center of the total range) and less fewer counts towards two sides. However, the type of distrubution cannot be definitively concluded due to a small sample size.
-   Assuming the scopus is the strength of an individual part made from this aluminum alloy, is the observed variability real or induced?
    -   The observed variability is natural, because the individual parts are made from the same aluminum alloy.

# Assessing Structural Safety

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*Objective*: In this challenge you are going to study a structure and assess its *probability of failure* (POF). A higher POF corresponds to a more unsafe structure. Ultimately, we want

$$\text{POF} < 0.03.$$

Your job is to assess a given structure using the data provided and determine whether you can *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`.

## Structural model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

The following code chunk sets up a structural model: We are considering a rectangular bar under uniaxial tensile load (as pictured above). A larger cross-sectional area `A` is capable of surviving a greater load `L`, but a larger `A` is a heavier (more expensive) structure. The internal stress is approximately `sigma = L / A`---we simply compare this quantity against the strength.

I pick particular values for `A, L` and package all the information in the *limit state function* `g_break`:

```{r model-setup}
## NOTE: No need to edit; model setup
A <- 0.0255 # Cross-sectional area
L <- 1000 # Applied load (lbs)

g_break <- function(strength) {
  strength - L / A
}
```

The *probability of failure* (POF) is then defined in terms of the limit state $g$ via:

$$\text{POF} \equiv \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0].$$

### **q2** Using the observations in `df_samples` and the structural model `g_break()`, estimate the probability of failure.

*Hint*: In `c07-monte-carlo` you learned how to estimate a probability as the `mean()` of an indicator. Use the same strategy here.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure; i.e. POF = Pr[g <= 0]
df_q2 <- df_samples %>%
  mutate(strength, g_q2 = g_break(strength), stat = as.integer(as.logical((g_break(strength) <= 0))))


POF <- mean(df_q2$stat)
POF
```

**Observations**:

-   Does this estimate satisfy `POF < 0.03`?
    -   Yes, as 0 \< 0.03.
-   Is this estimate of the probability of failure trustworthy? Why or why not?
    -   It's not trustworthy, because the sample size is way too small.
-   Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not.
    -   No, because we need at least 100 data points to produce a POF at exactly 0.03.

## Material property model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Since we have so few physical samples, we will fit a distribution to model the material property. This will give us the means to draw "virtual samples" and use those to estimate the POF.

### **q3** Fit a lognormal distribution to the strength data using the `fitdistr()` function.

*Note*: In this challenge I generated the `strength` data from a `lognormal` distribution; if you didn't know that fact, then the choice of distribution would be an *additional* source of uncertainty!

*Hint 1*: We learned how to do this in `e-stat08-fit-dist`.

*Hint 2*: The `fitdistr` function uses `densfun = "lognormal"` to specify a lognormal distribution.

```{r q3-task}
## TODO:
df_fit <- df_samples %>%
  pull(strength) %>%
  fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
  tidy()

df_fit
```

Once you've successfully fit a model for the strength, you can estimate the probability of failure by drawing samples from the fitted distribution.

### **q4** Complete the code below by 1. choosing a Monte Carlo sample size `n_monte_carlo`, 2. extracting the estimated parameters from q3, and 3. computing the limit state value `g = g_break()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint 1*: You will need to combine ideas from `c07-monte-carlo` and `e-stat08-fit-dist` in order to complete this task.

*Hint 2*: The function `rlnorm()` will allow you to draw samples from a lognormal distribution.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO 1: Choose Monte Carlo sample size
n_monte_carlo <- 100000

## TODO 2: Extract parameter estimates from df_fit
strength_meanlog <- 10.595117912
strength_sdlog <- 0.008750493

# Generate samples
df_norm_sim <-
  tibble(strength = rlnorm(n_monte_carlo, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)) %>%
## TODO 3: Compute structural response
  mutate(g = g_break(strength))

## NOTE: The following code estimates the POF and a 95% confidence interval
df_norm_pof <-
  df_norm_sim %>%
  mutate(stat = g <= 0) %>%
  summarize(
    pof_est = mean(stat),
    se = sd(stat) / sqrt(n_monte_carlo)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pof_lo = pof_est - 1.96 * se,
    pof_hi = pof_est + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(pof_lo, pof_est, pof_hi)

df_norm_pof
```

-   Assuming your scopus is the probability of failure `POF` defined above, does your estimate exhibit real variability, induced variability, or both?
    -   The estimation exhibits induced variability which comes from the sampling size of the Monte Carlo method.
-   Does this confidence interval imply that `POF < 0.03`?
    -   Yes, because the higher value is 0.0198, which is much smaller than 0.03. This implies that the estimation of POF would generally lie in the range that's equal to or smaller than 0.0198.
-   Compare this probability with your estimate from q2; is it more or less trustworthy?
    -   This probability is more trustworthy, because the model uses a sample size of 10,000, which is much greater compared to the 25 data points in q2.
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from the *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
    -   No, because the confidence interval above is only specific to the one data set generated by the Monte Carlo sampling method. It cannot capture the variability caused by the sample size of the Monte Carlo approximation.
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
    -   No, because the strength_meanlog and the strength_sdlog, both of which are used as sample generating parameters, are both derived from the original data set df_samples. Therefore, they are not capable to capture the uncertainty of the original sample.
-   What could you do to tighten up the confidence interval?
    -   Choose a greater sampling size for the Monte Carlo approximation.
-   Can you *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
    -   No, because the data set that we used to generate the estimated POF was also generated by a training model instead of a collection of real data.

## A different way to compute the POF

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Monte Carlo is a *general* way to estimate probabilities, but it introduces approximation error. It turns out that, for the simple problem we're studying, we can compute the probability directly using the CDF. Note that for our structural safety problem, we have

$$\text{POF} = \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0] = \mathbb{P}[S \leq L / A] = \text{CDF}_S(L/A).$$

Since `S = rlnorm(n, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`, we can use `plnorm` to compute the probability of failure without Monte Carlo as `POF = plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`. Let's combine this idea with the fitted distribution to estimate the POF.

### **q5** Finish the following function by computing the POF with `plnorm()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Complete the function below;
##       note that you only need to edit the TODO section
estimate_pof <- function(df) {

  ## Fit the distribution
  df_fit <-
    df %>%
    pull(strength) %>%
    fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
    tidy()

  ## Extract the parameters
  strength_meanlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "meanlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)
  strength_sdlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "sdlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)

## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure using plnorm
  pof_estimate <- plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)

  ## NOTE: No need to edit; this last line returns your pof_estimate
  pof_estimate
}

## NOTE: No need to edit; test your function
df_samples %>% estimate_pof()
```

**Observations**:

-   How does this estimate compare with your Monte Carlo estimate above?
    -   This estimate is slightly lower than the result generated using the Monte Carlo method (0.01898).
-   Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
    -   No, because the result doesn't vary according to the sample size.
-   With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo approximation* be induced or real?
    -   Induced.
-   Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *limited physical tests*? Why or why not?
    -   Yes, because more physical tests might be able to generate a distribution model that fits the data set better.
-   With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *limited physical tests* be induced or real?
    -   Induced, because the number of physical tests are decided by us and has nothing to do with the intrinsic variability of the quantity we're measuring itself.

## Quantifying sampling uncertainty

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Using `plnorm()` gets rid of Monte Carlo error, but we still have uncertainty due to limited physical testing. Often we can use a CLT approximation to construct a confidence interval. However, with `plnorm()` we can't use a CLT approximation because it does not follow the assumptions of the central limit theorem (it's not a sum of iid random variables). Instead, we can use the *bootstrap* to approximate a confidence interval via resampling.

### **q6** The code below estimates a bootstrap CI on your POF estimate. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q6-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
tidycustom <- function(est) {tibble(term = "pof", estimate = est)}

df_samples %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimates = map(
      splits,
      ~ analysis(.x) %>% estimate_pof() %>% tidycustom()
    )
  ) %>%
  int_pctl(estimates)
```

**Observations**:

-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *Monte Carlo approximation* of the POF? Why or why not?
    -   The uncertainty is not accounted because we did not apply the normal distribution function to obtain the estimate.
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
    -   No, because the confidence interval only accounts for the model generated from the 25 tests in df_samples and cannot address the situations when the test size is greater or smaller than 25.
-   Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
    -   No. The sample size that is used to generate the fitted model is too small, which means we're not sure if our model is actually a good fit to the question that we're looking into.
